## Getting Started with Flask

> Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
$ # Virtualenv modules installation (Unix-based systems)
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$
$ # Virtualenv modules installation (Windows-based systems)
$ # virtualenv env
$ # .\env\Scripts\activate
```

<br />

> Install `Flask`

```bash
$ pip install flask
```

<br />

> Edit your first Flask app `main.py`

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello from Flask!'
```

<br />

> Setup the environment

```bash
$ # Set the FLASK_APP environment variable
$ (Unix/Mac) export FLASK_APP=main.py
$ (Windows) set FLASK_APP=main.py
$ (Powershell) $env:FLASK_APP = ".\main.py" 
```

<br />

> Start the app

```bash
$ flask run
$
$ # Access the app in browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
